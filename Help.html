        <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#FF9900">My students are so young! I’m worried that teaching them about human trafficking is too much. </h3>
        <p class="text-center"> Guria has created a curriculum to aid teachers in introducing the notion of human trafficking in an age-appropriate and understandable way. It can be accessed in the <a href="download.html">Downloadable Resources page</a>. You know your students best, but we believe that The March 18th FREEDOM NOW Global Art Exchange & Exhibit is a wonderful opportunity to introduce any age of students to real-world issues—through a lens of hope, creativity, and empowerment. It is a chance for students to understand the increasing interconnectedness of our world, and gain confidence in their ability to make a difference in it!</p>
          <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#FF9900">  I don’t have very much time, but I love this project idea! How can I participate?
</h3>
        <p class="text-center"> Some teachers are teaching a whole unit on human trafficking with in-depth art creation, while others are teaching a very brief lesson with art creation as a quick homework assignment. Aditionally, Guria’s curriculum which can be accessed in the <a href="download.html">Downloadable Resources page</a>, provides resources to lead students through learning about human trafficking, understanding their involvement in the project, and finally creating art. This curriculum is optional and provides helpful resources for teachers who don’t have sufficient time to create their own lessons.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#FF9900">  I’m not a teacher! How can I implement this project at my school?
</h3>
        <p class="text-center"> Many people implementing the March 18th FREEDOM NOW
Global Art Exchange & Exhibit are not teachers! Especially in high school and college, student leaders have emerged to coordinate their school’s involvement. Some are teaching about trafficking at a school assembly, some at a student club meeting, and some during a visit to a class. Some are facilitating art creation after school, some with requests for art on posters throughout campus, or some during lunch.
</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#FF9900"> I’m not a school! Can I still participate?
</h3>
        <p class="text-center">Of course! The March 18th FREEDOM NOW Global Art Exchange & Exhibit was initially designed for schools, but we would also like to encourage the participation of groups of any affiliations (private art classes, community centers, informal groups of friends, religious congregations, etc.)
 </p>
        <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#FF9900">My school has a date conflict with March 18th. Is it still possible for me to participate? 
 </h3>
        <p class="text-center"> Yes. For serious date conflicts, (for example: a holiday when school is not in session, or another major event conflict,) we ask that schools hold their exhibit on the closest possible date to March 18th, and inform viewers of their honorary participation in the March 18th event.
</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#FF9900"> What kind of art is acceptable?
</h3>
        <p class="text-center">To learn about what art to create and see examples of acceptable art, download Guria’s Guidelines for Art Creation in the <a href="/download.html">Downloadable Resources page.</a>
